        <h1 class="text-center">why visit asheville </h1>
      <p class="text-center">As part of the #CoopsinCarolina fall adventure, we spent 3 nights in Asheville, North Carolina.
        I knew Asheville only because for beer. That it supposedly had the most breweries per capita of
        any town in America.  But I was pleasantly surprised by the walkable downtown, the crisp fall air, and
        the easy access to the mountains.</p>

        <h3 class="text-center"> the classic stop </h3>
        <p class="text-center"> <a href="http://wickedweedbrewing.com/">Wicked Weed</a> is the perfect place to start your Asheville
          adventure. The Tap Room is on Biltmore Avenue where, the perfect location to hop (no pun intended) around to
          other independent local places after.  Wicked Weed is known for West Coast hoppy ales and Belgian ales: two of
          this little ladies favorites.  There's a large bar and tables for dining, with a loud and energetic vibe. </div>

            <div class="col-md-4">
              <h3 class="text-center"> the one that got away </h3>
          <p class="text-center"> <a href="http://www.oneworldbrewing.com/">One World Brewing</a> is a nano-brewery, meaning their batches are small.
            We experienced this first-hand as almost all of their kegs were empty when we stopped in on
            a Monday night.  Had it been a Friday night, beer-flowing, this place would have been awesome.
            Its an underground hole-in-the-wall, with darts and other bar games and a DJ some nights. I would
            definitely give One World another go as they have a wide pallete of beers to brew.</div>

                <h3 class="text-center"> all about the meat </h3>
            <p class="text-center"> <a href="http://www.oneworldbrewing.com/">12 Bones</a> is more of an indulgent food
            stop than a beer stop, so if you want to stay pint-sized don't do what we did. We stopped here
          around 3:00 PM in the afternoon for "snack"...? Ribs and a million sides later - we ruined our dinners.
          The sides (all of them) are the best things to order so splurge on those instead of the meat. Also check out the Cheer Wine,
          an Asheville classic soda that tastes like a better Dr. Pepper. </div>
